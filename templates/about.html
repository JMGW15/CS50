  <h2>About</h2>
  <h4>What is T4NT?</h4>
    <p>T4NT is a community-driven initiative that seeks to create and support a homegrown pipeline of exceptional leaders within the Consumer Engagement organization.  Through participation in a series of workshops, seminars, mentoring opportunities, case study reviews, and other activities, individuals from business and creative roles can expand their area of influence by building their technical muscle over time.  These activities will establish or reinforce knowledge of technical concepts critical to becoming effective leaders and participants will be coached on how to drive the success of technical teams, ask the right questions in technical discussions, and guide the careers of technical contributors (i.e. - SDEs, SDMs, and TPMs). Prospective participants are not required to attend all sessions, but are encouraged to do so to earn phone tool certification awards! </p>
  <h4>What problem does T4NT solve?</h4>
    <p>The T4NT initiative solves two problems: 1) It helps create resources and training opportunities for business and creative contributors seeking to move into leadership roles (L7+); and 2) It helps minimize the challenges related to recruiting top leadership talent by building a leadership-ready pool of candidates from within.
    <br>
    To maintain the positive momentum of CE teams, sustain the growth of the organization, and support career development opportunities for business and creative individuals, the CE community seeks to create pathways to develop top leadership talent from within. Effective leaders at Amazon have a significant impact across a wide spectrum of both business- and tech-related projects and decisions.  Their broad base of experience and knowledge across both realms allows them to positively influence the product vision, prioritize appropriately, reduce friction in product and software development processes through auditing, and uphold high standards of operational excellence. These high-value qualities of a leader result in the ongoing delivery of substantial customer benefits by an inspired/enthusiastic team and their comprehensive understanding of what it takes to create a rewarding environment where multi-disciplinary teams thrive helps these leaders attract and retain top talent. We want CE to be the organization where leaders like this are created!</p>

  <h4>Tenets</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Come one, come all is the rule - Topics presented as part of the T4NT learning series will have the potential to positively impact all non-tech contributors (managers and ICs) within any organization at Amazon, but we prioritize topics that have a direct impact on individuals L6+ and within the PM, PM-T, and PrgM job families. We maintain learner trust by gatekeeping topics and maintaining a high bar for the quality of presentations. Some topics may be of more interest or more applicable to one group vs. another, but all are invited to attend.</li>
        <li>We’ve got talent – The T4NT working group will prioritize look for technical talent from the organization that is sponsoring the series to lead the workshops and seminars. In doing so, the T4NT series will provide technical contributors with the opportunity to showcase their expertise and will foster relationship building between the non-tech and tech communities. If there is a topic for which we cannot identity a subject matter expert for within the host organization, the T4NT working group will seek experts from outside the org or even from 3rd party providers.</li>
        <li>Stay fresh, never grow stale – Hot or timely tech-related topics change are never consistent from one point in time to the next. As a result, the T4NT curriculum will continue to evolve. New content will be developed on a regular basis in response to survey data and developments within the organization and existing content will be updated prior to each seminar as a rule.</li>
        <li>Often imitated, often duplicated – The T4NT series will be developed in a way that any organization can borrow the processes of the working group and repurpose the materials for their non-tech community. We keep production overhead low so that we can get information to those that will benefit from it quickly and efficiently.</li>
        <li>Abstraction, not instruction – Topics covered within the T4NT series will focus on helping the non-tech community understand technical concepts grounded in case studies and use to use that information to improve their contributions to the business and interactions with the technical community. T4NT courses will not provide detailed instructions on how to code or review in-depth technical processes. We will, however, help non-tech contributors find pathways to obtain detailed knowledge.</li>
