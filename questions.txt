1.  Stdint.h is a header file that allows one to use a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types and their min/max values.
2.  Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t allows one to define the maximum value of that datatype.  For example, maximum value of uint8_t (or unsigned char, or 1 byte) = 255
3.  Total bytes in a:
BYTE - one byte 
DWORD - 4 bytes
LONG - 4 bytes
WORD - 2 bytes
4.  Characters B, then M
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file including the headerfiles.
    biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file and is a constant size of 40 bytes.
6.  If biheight is negative the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount specifies the number of bits pers pixel for a RGB file
8.  fopen will return null if the file is missing, the file (in line 27) is read only, the network is down, or there are permission issues.
9.  On success, fread() and fwrite() return the number of items read or written, or the number of bytes transferred, only when size is 1 per the CS50 reference
10. Each row of a BMP files takes up (8 pixels) or 24 bytes, therefore the number in a scanline must be a multiple of 4.  If it's not the file will contain padding. 
11. FSEEK is used to move file pointer position to the given location.
12. A variable of FSEEK, SEEK_CUR moves the file pointer to a given location vs. the beginning or the end of a file.
